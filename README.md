# Ninja ID app

A simple Flutter project to get my feet wet in the world of Dart & Flutter. I wrote another exact same in React Native to compare with the one uses Flutter. The app has 1 clickable button at bottom right to increase the "Ninja level".

## About
This is a dead simple app I wrote just to compare the following points between Flutter app (this one) vs. [React Native app](https://github.com/QuangTran304/Ninja-ID-ReactNative)
- Code / language structure
- Syntax
- Separation of concerns
- Ease of implementation

## Instructions
- Main app entry point is `lib/main.dart`
- Download Flutter first, add flutter bin to your $PATH ( export PATH="$PATH:`pwd`/flutter/bin" )
- Download & install Android Studio (required)
- Run `Flutter doctor` to check if all dependencies are installed
- Install Flutter plugin & Dart plugin in VSCode / Android Studio
- Open VSCode / Android Studio ==> Select an emulator ==> Run `Flutter run` command
