# Ninja ID app

A simple Flutter project to get my feet wet in the world of Dart & Flutter. I wrote another exact same in React Native to compare with the one uses Flutter. The app has 1 clickable button at bottom right to increase the "Ninja level".

## About
This is a dead simple app I wrote just to compare the following points between Flutter app (this one) vs. [React Native app](https://github.com/QuangTran304/Ninja-ID-ReactNative)
- Code / language structure
- Syntax
- Separation of concerns
- Ease of implementation
